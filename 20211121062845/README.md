# Background and Foreground Running Programs

* *fg* command moves job to the foreground
* `script&` takes process to the background
* `jobs` to see if you forgot to kill any useless process
 * `'kill %1' to kill job numer 1
* `kill -l` to see all kill signals (`kill -9` to cut it off for good)
* use `crontab` to schedule jobs
